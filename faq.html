    <p><strong>What are the responsibilities of owning a pet?</strong></p>
While owning a dog or cat is extremely rewarding and fun, there are many responsibilites to keep in mind before adopting. While the cost of adopting may be less than purchasing, it is still a financial commitment that does not end when the adoption fee is paid. Your pet will need a bed, toys, food, bowls, a leash, a harness, and more. Besides this, you are responisible for your new pet's medical care after they enter your home. This means you need to keep up with vaccinations and take care of any medical issues that may pop up, which is an additional cost. Aside from financial obligations, owning a pet is a huge (but rewarding) time commitment. You need to be prepared to take your dog or cat for walks and provide playtime that suits their level of energy. A bored pet is a destructive pet. You also have to be prepared to deal with any behavioral issues that a dog or cat may have upon arriving at home. This means cleaning up any accidents in the house, dealing with chewing on things they shouldn't, etc. Behavioral issues are certainly something that can be worked through, but the adopter needs to be aware that these things take additional time and patience to work through. Adopting a pet can be an incredible experience, but only if you are properly prepared and have considered all the obligations adoption entails.
<p><strong>How does the cost of adoption compare to purchasing a pet?</strong></p>
   Typically, the rescue fee for a dog can range from $60 to $250; the fee for a cat can range from $35 to $175. This fee is dependent on the age of the pet, its health, and other factors. Included in that fee are starter vaccinations, spaying/neutering, and even a microchip. Purchasing a dog or cat can cost anywhere from $250 to $3000, depending on breed and pedigree. Vaccinations, spaying/neutering, and microchipping are not included in this fee. All three of these basic prodedures can cost anywhere from $200 to $350. Adopting a dog or cat is ultimately a cost-effective and life saving option.
<p><strong>What if I already have another pet?</strong></p>
Many dogs and cats thrive from having a companion. If you are considering adding to your furry family, it is essential to bring your current pet either to the shelter or to another location to hold a meet and greet before you bring the new animal home. If the animals get along, both you and your pet will have gained a wonderful companion.
<p><strong>What if I'm looking for a particular breed?</strong></p>
Animal shelters often have "pure-bred" dogs and cats as well as some really lovable mutts. If you have your heart set on a particular breed, check your local shelter's website periodically to see if the breed you are looking for shows up.
<p><strong>Do shelters have puppies and kittens?</strong></p>
Shelters often have an abundance of kittens in the spring! Puppies are also usually available year-round. Again, be sure to check your local shelter's website if you are looking for a particular animal.
<p><strong>How can I help if I am not able to adopt?</strong></p>
You can always talk to your local shelter about volunteering. Shelters are in constant need of friendly faces to help with walks or socializing the animals. Donations are always helpful, whether they are monetary or supplies like food, towels, and toys. Check with your local shelter to see what items they are in need of and their guidelines for donations. If you are not able to take on a pet permanently but still want to get more involved, fostering is a great option. You can help an animal become ready to be someone's best friend.
